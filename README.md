An diet-tracking app for busy people. 

This app was prototyped during StarterHacks 2019 at the University of Waterloo. It is an app that allowed users to track what they ate visually instead of numerically. It allows categorization of meals into the three main meals of a day which is then saved on a database where the user can access the photos at a later date. This allows the user to reflect upon the quality and quantity of their meals. We wanted to make this an app that encourages healthy eating habits so we added features such as:
* Current and desired weight input
* Goals tab to track progress towards desired weight
* Calendar to access meals on different dates

Also, we thought it was important to create a platform where user interaction was present, so we allowed users to create profiles, explore what others were eating from the "Explore" page, and share recipes of the meals they took photos of. Of course, each personal profile has a feed of photos which consists of their posts. It is important to note that we created this app as a motivational tool, rather than something to enforce people to eat a certain way.
